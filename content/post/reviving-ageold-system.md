# PC SPECS
I bought my first PC in 2012. It had:
- Intel Pentium E6600 dual core CPU
- 2GB DDR3 RAM (1333 MHz with CL9)
- 450 W SMPS
- NVIDIA GT 710 2GB DDR3 (added in 2018 for 2<sup>nd</sup> monitor)
- Dual Monitor (2<sup>nd</sup> added lately for my work efficiency)

# Utilizations
I use this PC pretty much for every thing.
- watching movies
- listening songs
- browsing
- streaming
- coding
- 4-5 terminals doing background tasks
- a server serving home

# Hell Experience

Earlier, till 2016 I was using Windows. Which became nightmare, PC suddenly froze while all work of 2-3 hrs lost. This happened periodically in 3-4 hrs every day.

# Light OSes
Linux is like that great Hindustani `SAGE` which enlightens about 'every one 💪 is as mighty as Microsoft kind guys 💪'. While tinkering and quite reading, there were few alternatives I prepared:
- XFCE
- LXDE
- LXQT

From above UIs I happily use LXQT, it offers quite good (GUI - obviously, it's QT after all ;) (if it matters to you) and also being light weight I can easily work all day long just sacrificing few multimedia enjoyments while working.

# Light environment
VS Code is also heavy for such kind of systems. Further improving this I created small tool which monitored GIT and helped me in managing updates with GIT all in `Command Line Interface`.

I simply use inbuilt editor and VIM/nano/pico.

## Remarks
Since being system programmer, I love to use products which are `OPEN` & `NEW`. It helps me thinking about how heavy functionalities can be introduced with lightest touches.
