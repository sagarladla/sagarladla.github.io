      <description>Using Serveo you may briefly expose your site to the Internet with end-to-end encryption, no sign-up required. Use this to Work Offline and quietly poke a hole through your NAT or firewall to move information more discretely.
Warning: No form of communication over the Internet is 100% secure. Serve and expose your site with the following command:
$ hugo serve --disableLiveReload &amp;amp; ssh -R 80:localhost:1313 serveo.net Once started press g for traffic inspection, or quit to go offline and use fg to return to hugo.</description>

View help docs locally by navigating to http://localhost:1414 following a Quick Install or after running the Upgrade Script. Internet connection not required.
If help is not running you may start it anytime via script:
cd flying-toasters &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \ ./themes/after-dark/bin/help Or simply create an alias and serve docs with live-reload:
alias hs=&amp;#39;hugo serve --navigateToChanged&amp;#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \ hs --port 1414 --source themes/after-dark/docs Help is included within the After Dark source code.</description>

      <description>Unless running the Quick Install After Dark does not require an Internet connection to function. Leverage this feature in creative ways:
Use Ephemeral Hosting to report news without tipping off authorities. Run your site behind a NAT or firewall blocking all outbound requests. Review the Online Help docs during a flight on Virgin Galactic. Keep a personal journal while couchsurfing through Southeast Asia. Develop your content using Termux on Android in airplane mode.</description>

Review the Online Help docs during a flight on Virgin Galactic. Keep a personal journal while couchsurfing through Southeast Asia. Develop your content using Termux on Android in airplane mode. Create an Image Gallery while trekking the Mount Nimbus via ferrata. By default After Dark makes no outbound requests except when viewing certain Online Help documentation to cover related functionality.
